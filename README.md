# Seam-Carving
Seam Carving is a project I worked on for my Computer Vision course at Georgia Tech. In this project, I was given the task to perform content-aware image resizing, in other words, I implemented an algorithm that preserves the main content of the images while expanding or reducing the dimensions of the images.
